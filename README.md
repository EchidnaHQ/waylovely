A lovely attempt at running the [Anvil](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay) compositor for Wayland in Android.

This attempt is not yet complete thoo, but it's theoritically posbbile! Winit itself has an Android support, though I'm not sure whether it'll run nicely or not! ^^ We'll investigate and make the patches if we can. <3

## Xdg Desktop Portal implementation for Android
This project also contains an implementation for Xdg Desktop Portal for Android. This allows softwares that already use existing Linux APIs to call Android APIs trough the Portals' abstractions!

But, this is not also yet complete!  

## Let's help me hack this!
First of all, you will need to download the API 29 of Android SDK and the `23.2.8568313` version of the NDK! It's currently hardcoded to the absolute path of my SDK installation so you'll have to change that first.

To compile a native library. Add the Git repo as a submodule to `app/jni`. Then, there are some scripts in the `app/jni` folder! Instead of running let's say, 'meson _build', run the corresponding script like this in the root directory of the package's source!
```sh
../meson.sh -Ddocumentation=false \ # Pass your Meson arguments to the script!
            -Dc_link_args="-v" # It'll pass it to Meson!
```
Then run the command to compile the package! It'll get installed to `app/libs/$ARCH_ABI/$PACKAGE_NAME` ^^

ARCH_ABI is the LLVM ABI target that we're compiling to! Currently it's hardcoded to `armv7a-linux-androideabi`, the ABI of most Android devices! 
For the package name, the script will use the basename of the current working directory ^^
